# Case Study: Chicago Bike Sharing User Insights

### Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into how different riders use a Chicago-based bike sharing company's services over the span of a year. Through analysis of various aspects of the trip data, we seek to identify usage trends which differentiate subscribers to the service ("annual members") from pay-per-trip riders ("casual riders"). This allows us to make data-driven recommendations to the company to aid them in thier goal of converting more casual riders into annual members.

### The Question

The question we're answering is the following: **How do annual members and casual riders use the company's bikes differently?**
